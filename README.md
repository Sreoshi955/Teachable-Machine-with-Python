Teachable Machine 

This project is a Python-based Teachable Machine. It allows users to upload your own images, assign class labels, train a custom deep learning model, and predict new inputs â€” all in one interactive web app using Gradio and TensorFlow.

Features

* Upload image data with user-defined class labels
* Build and train a CNN model instantly
* Predict class of new images using the trained model
* Web interface powered by [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app)
* Model saved locally (.h5 format) after training

Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy
* OpenCV (for image resizing)
* Gradio (for UI)

Future Enhancements

* Add support for audio or pose classification
* Allow users to export trained models
* Include training progress visualizations
